# sparklib - Mini Charts for Your Sparkling App

> **Note**: Documentation is very much work in progress and currently lacking in detail.

A lightweight library featuring a fluid API for easy creation of sparkline charts. Separate packages for [Angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-sparklib) and [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sparklib) components are available.

## What is a Sparkline Chart?

A sparkline is a minimalist, word-sized graphic that shows data trends with typographic clarity. In its most basic form, a sparkline lacks axes, labels, and gridlines, although **sparklib** offers simple support for these elements. Sparklines can be seamlessly embedded in text, tables, or headlines to provide a quick, contextual view of data variations.

## What Isn't a Sparkline Chart?

Sparklines are not suited for detailed data analysis requiring full support for axes, labels, legends, or gridlines. If you need these features or interactivity, consider using a full-fledged charting library like [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

## Further Reading

Sparklines have a long history but the name itself was introduced by Edward Tufte in his book [Beautiful Evidence](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR) in 2006.

Wikipedia also has a nice description of [sparklines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline).
