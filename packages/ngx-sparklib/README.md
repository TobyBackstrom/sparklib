## What is a Sparkline Chart?

A sparkline is a minimalist, word-sized graphic that shows data trends with typographic clarity. In its most basic form, a sparkline lacks axes, labels, and gridlines, although **sparklib** offers basic support for these elements. Sparklines can be seamlessly embedded in text, tables, or headlines to provide a quick, contextual view of data variations.
